# OS Package

## We can interact with files by using the OS package in pretty low level, and the functionality is similar with C

### Oflag

```golang
 	// Exactly one of O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, or O_RDWR must be specified.
	O_RDONLY int = syscall.O_RDONLY // open the file read-only.
	O_WRONLY int = syscall.O_WRONLY // open the file write-only.
	O_RDWR   int = syscall.O_RDWR   // open the file read-write.
	// The remaining values may be or'ed in to control behavior.
	O_APPEND int = syscall.O_APPEND // append data to the file when writing.
	O_CREATE int = syscall.O_CREAT  // create a new file if none exists.
	O_EXCL   int = syscall.O_EXCL   // used with O_CREATE, file must not exist.
	O_SYNC   int = syscall.O_SYNC   // open for synchronous I/O.
	O_TRUNC  int = syscall.O_TRUNC  // truncate regular writable file when opened. / Delete all the content of the file if it exits
```
